# Establishing Connectivity - the Engine

Every SQLAlchemy application that connects to a database needs to use an `Engine`. The `Engine` is created by using the `create_engine()` function:

```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite+pysqlite:///:memory:", echo=True)
```

The string URL is composed of:
- The kind of database: `sqlite`
- The DBAPI: `pysqlite`
- The database location: `/:memory`:

Passing `echo=True` ensures that the `Engine` will log all of the SQL it emits to a Python logger that will write to standard out.
