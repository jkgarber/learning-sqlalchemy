# SQLAlchemy Tutorial

I create a slightly filtered version of the official tutorial. I spend a fair bit of time on the first reading in order to create these notes in a way that works for me, which makes all subsequent reads much more efficient.

I use this time to also think about ways which I might use the code in my projects.
